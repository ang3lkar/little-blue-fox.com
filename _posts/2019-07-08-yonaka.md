This was my second discovery from Brighton after Black Honey. [Yonaka](https://weareyonaka.com/) also come from the same city and have the same structure with a confident female voice at the front.

Yonaka cleave closely to the punk tradition, they bombard you with direct catchy hooks ready to captivate your ear. Their sound is remiscent of Paramore and emit a No Doubt vibe, with a barrage of chugging guitars and hammering drum fills, a surplus of rock heavy riffs spiced up with the grimy UK attitude.

Their first album suffers from the child sicknesses of the debut albums, all songs although instantly gratifying, they fail to dig into deeper realm. And that is fine for now, they have certainly captivated us. The question is whether the band will prove themselves in the future.
