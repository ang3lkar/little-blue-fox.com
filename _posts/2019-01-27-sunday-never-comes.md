title: Ethan Hawke - Sunday Never Comes

We all know that Sunday morning call. The Saturday explosion is left back and it left just silence behind. You can finally wear your hoodie, savor your coffee and hug your girl.

"Sunday never comes" encapsulates this feeling. It's warm, calm and soothing track. And also a bit sad, because Sundays are a little sad. I find Ethan's voice to be comforting like chamomile. Memories bloom out of my head when I listen to this song.

A similar essence with a 60's flavor, can also be found in "Strange Magic" by Electric Light Orchestra.
