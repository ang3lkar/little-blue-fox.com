Keep Shelly In Athens maintain an excellent [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/keepshellyinathens/playlist/1ZWowxGpk3ezQijQ2GNJKU?si=wMAhdKxtTbqXU9NjPCImfw) in which I discovered Mexico City Blondes, a dynamic duo from California with a handful of views but full of potential.

"Addio" has a juicy nightly sound, with a scratchy guitar solo among its selective loops. It's hardly their best track but it was enough for me to dig into them. The rest of the band's tracks also worth a listen.
