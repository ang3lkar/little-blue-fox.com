I'll be honest here. I hated Foo Fighters all my life, I always considered them a cheap kind of chic rock who take themselves more seriously than they should.

However, I decided to watch their documentary, ["Back and Forth"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853563/). I got the feeling that they are a band enjoying what they do and slowly pushing their limits forward without sacrificing their core sound.

There is a point in the film where they record the "Wasting Lighting" album  (in analog) in Dave Grohl's house while with their kids are playing outside in the pool. I found it an extremely refreshing take on an album recording. Plus I heard a couple of songs that caught my ear, so I started listening to the album. And it's much better than my former self would expect.

I loved the whole album, but I'll post just the song that tiggled my senses.
