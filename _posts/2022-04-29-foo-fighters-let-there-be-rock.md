After reading [Dave Grohl's memoir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57648017-the-storyteller), I started listening to Foo fighters more seriously. Although I didn't like them at first, they somehow managed to turn that ship around.

And I stumbled upon this gem. Oh, the raw intensity of this cover. The magic groove in every second of it.

They nailed it. The raw energy of early AC/DC is there in every note.
