Yet another british band I liked this year. Thank God for corporate music Slack channels :)

Luka State produce powerful, melodious crisply timed indie pop at its finest, Artic Monkeys with a more pop-ish sound if I may say so. Sturdy guitars with some infused electronic elements here and there.

They released a catchy tune that I have been hearing on repeat all day. Please, have a seat, relax and have a taste of pure british, cinematic video:
