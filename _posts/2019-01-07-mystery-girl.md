This is what you would get if you combined Alex Turner's songwriting with Lana del Rey's vocal style.

The track has a heavily atmospheric and dreamy sound, which makes it ideal for night driving. A horror movie riff establishes the track and the James Bond guitar supplements it with a mystery flavor.
