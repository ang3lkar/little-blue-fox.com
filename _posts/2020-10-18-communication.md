A beautiful song that left me speechless the first time I heard it. As most people, I learned its existence because of Miley Cyrus' MTV Unplugged sessions in 2020.

It's the first track of the Cardigans album and serves really well as an intro.

Isn't it as warm as a kids blanket?



[Verse 1]
For twenty-seven years I've been trying
To believe and confide in
Different people I've found
Some of them got closer than others
Some wouldn't even bother
And then you came around
I didn't really know what to call you
You didn't know me at all
But I was happy to explain
I never really knew how to move you
So I tried to intrude through
The little holes in your veins
And I saw you

[Chorus 1]
But that's not an invitation, that's all I get
If this is communication, I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect
So I disconnect

[Verse 2]
You always seem to know where to find me
And I'm still here behind you
In the corner of your eye
I'll never really learn how to love you
But I know that I love you
Through the hole in the sky
Where I see you
[Chorus 2]
And that's not an invitation, that's all I get
If this is communication, I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect
So I disconnect

[Chorus 3]
Well this is an invitation, its not a threat
If you want communication, that's what you get
I'm talking and talking but I don't know how to connect
And I hold a record for being patient
With your kind of hesitation
I need you, you want me but I don't know how to connect
So I disconnect
I disconnect
