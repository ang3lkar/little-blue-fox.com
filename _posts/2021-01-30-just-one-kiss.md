Imelda May started as a rockabilly entertainer but she has matured and reached a much higher point than that. I was aghast with this collaboration. Noel's voice syncs perfectly with Imelda's in this juicy, vuloptuous, sexy track.

## Lyrics
```
"Wanna fool around?"
What you said
A simple little phrase can only go to my head
Bad side, good side
Upside down
You were foolin' no one when you said, "Let's fool around"
```

```
Just one kiss
But what could come from this? (Oh-oh)
Just one kiss
But what could come from this?
Mammalian
Mammalian
```

```
Movin' like an animal
Got caught in my eye
You pull me a little closer
Dancin' thigh to thigh
You had to run away
You headed to the door
I counted to one
And you were back for more
```

```
Just one kiss
But what could come from this? (Yeah)
Just one kiss
But what could come from this?
Mammalian (Oh-oh)
Mammalian (Oh)
Mammalian (Oh)
Mammalian (Oh)
```

[Guitar Solo: Ron Wood]

[Bridge: Imelda May]
```
Kneel at my temple
Drink from my well
Oh, babe, the only way is down
If you're headed to hell
Hold your head high
Look at my lunar eclipse
Send me to Heaven, baby
With your lips, yeah
```

```
Just one kiss (Just one kiss)
But what could come from this? (Just one kiss)
Oh, just one kiss (Just one kiss)
But what could come from this? (Oh, what could come from this?)
Oh, mammalian
(Just one kiss) oh, mammalian
(Just one kiss) Mammalian
(Just one kiss) Mammalian
Mammalian kiss, kiss
```

```
Just one kiss, what could come from this?
Oh, baby, just one kiss, what could come from this?
Oh, baby
```
