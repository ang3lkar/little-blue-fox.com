And another track from an almost non-existent duo. There is hardly a single trace for Lili & Sam found anywhere in the internet, which can be considered an accomplishment nowadays.

After considerable research, this is from [Leona Naess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leona_Naess), an amazing British (and underrated) artist and [Sam Bisbee](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083851), a singer/songwriter/producer/director.

This sweet track has a solid piano underneath serving the Leona's smooth vocals on top. It's also served with an unusual structure, no clean chorus and refrain bridge parts can be distinguished.

It seems this is something written exclusively for a cosmetics or shampoo ad, and they just decided to release it as a single.
