An amazing, absolutely magnificent retro cover of a classic track.

Keep Shelly In Athens' sound does not remind anything of a greek production, which I consider a major plus. One of this year's great entries for my "Night Driving" playlist.

It's slow but rythmic pace and soothing vocals bind together in a solid package.
