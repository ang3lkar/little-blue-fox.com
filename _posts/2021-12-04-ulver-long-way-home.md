The Norwegian **Ulver** have become one of my favorite bands mostly because of their ferocious appetite to  Theyexperiment. Each release from them is something new and unexpected since they have traversed a wide range of genres. Even their live releases are songs that do not have presence in traditional albums. They are simply one the the most interesting and exciting bands to ever exist and just keep going.

That said, 'Live in Hexahedron' is not another live album. It contains new songs that travel a synth ambient path. The production is lush and warm. It's mostly instrumental which makes it perfect for coding accompaniment.

The last track of this 6-track album is a 20 minute masterpiece. It's virtually simple, with a continuous beat but busrting with elements that make you listen to it again and again. I particularly adore the masterful tempo change in the middle of it.
