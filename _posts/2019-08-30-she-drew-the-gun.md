It is always english bands that catch my ears. This time it was [She drew the gun](https://open.spotify.com/artist/47meGvCz0CZklN50dgzjmL). Playful but aggressive female-led pop which glistens with sonic flair.

The vocalist Louisa Roach is exceptionally cool, she brims with confidence.

#### Something for the pain
