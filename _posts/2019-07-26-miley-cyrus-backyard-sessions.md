Of course, my old self used to reject Miley just because she is "pop" plus I hate that aggressive and face-shoving attitude. But I soon realised the girl is more than just a pretty face. She has possibly the best voice I've ever heard.

Her covers in the [backyard sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_Sessions) are absolutely amazing and the production overall is superb. Rich sound that fills your ears with joy.

#### So happy together

You just can't get bored with this voice.


#### Don't dream it's over

Another one, Miley's vocal like fine wine with Ari sweet champagne voice , perfection.


#### Look what they've done to my song

Yes, that's definitely better than the original.
