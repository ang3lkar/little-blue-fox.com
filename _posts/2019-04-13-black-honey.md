Who knew that Brighton would give birth to such a unique band?

Black Honey have maintained a meticulous profile so far, with a fantastic debut album 4 years in the making, plus a handful of excellent singles, a consistent surf-rock-pulp-fiction direction and complete creative control on their merchandise.

The band has cultivated a firm sound that combines 90s indie rock, psychedelic guitars and the sheen of Lana Del Reyâ€™s pretty melancholy. All these while Izzy Philips delivers vocals with sniper precision.

Have a listen to their fantastic debut album:
