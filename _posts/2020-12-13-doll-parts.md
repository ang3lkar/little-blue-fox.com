"Doll Parts" was poem that Love wrote about Kurt Cobain, in 1991, before they started dating. As such, it is mainly about her insecurity that someone as wonderful to her as him could be interested in her. When the song was recorded, she and Cobain were married. By the time the album was released, he was dead – and the result is this video, with a faceless child representing Cobain, as the song takes on a completely new meaning.

Consider it the perfect companion to Plastic Hearts — since a plastic heart, after all, is a doll part.
