I"4<p>The first song of 2020 that stuck in my ears, is Billie’s first single after her debut album, “Everything I wanted”. Apart from the production, Billie also directed the video clip!</p>

<p>You can recognize her signature sound: singing incredibly softly, bordering on a whisper.</p>

<p>This may sound simplistic, but after some listening to her work, you can realize that her voice can shine in the fourth and fifth octaves, but can also employ an extremely airy falsetto, which is quite rare and requires a lot of energy.</p>

<p>Billie is supposedly the hottest act and the most revolutionary artits right now. An overrated opinion, but not because she’s not talented or not writing good music. It’s because, like all artists, of the impossible standards placed upon her. She is definitely not redefining music; nobody has done this for a long time now.</p>

<p>The refrain in the live version gives me goosebumps.</p>
