I";<p>Holy Motors have have a laconic bio on Spotify that certainly captches the bandâ€™s essence:</p>

<p><em>HOLY MOTORS is a twang and reverb band from Estonia. This band of five pushes to forgo simple definitions. They are cowboys at heart who come off as shoegazers by their presence and dreamcatchers in their music.</em></p>

<p>Ethereal vocals on the front while the rest of the band cruises with an aboundant reverb on the 3(!) guitars .</p>

<p>Their have released a handful of singles and an EP, Slow Sundown and they all trascend the same point in the music spectrum; slow and chilly songs that can be the soundtrack of your nightmares.</p>
