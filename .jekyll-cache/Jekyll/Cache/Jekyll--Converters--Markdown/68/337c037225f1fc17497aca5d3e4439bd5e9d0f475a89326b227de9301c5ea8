I"<p>Of course, my old self used to reject Miley just because she is “pop” plus I hate that aggressive and face-shoving attitude. But I soon realised the girl is more than just a pretty face. She has possibly the best voice I’ve ever heard.</p>

<p>Her covers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_Sessions">backyard sessions</a> are absolutely amazing and the production overall is superb. Rich sound that fills your ears with joy.</p>

<p>Another one, Miley’s vocal like fine wine with Ari sweet champagne voice , perfection.</p>
