I"Ã<p>Keep Shelly In Athens maintain an excellent <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/keepshellyinathens/playlist/1ZWowxGpk3ezQijQ2GNJKU?si=wMAhdKxtTbqXU9NjPCImfw">playlist</a> in which I discovered Mexico City Blondes, a dynamic duo from California with a handful of views but full of potential.</p>

<p>â€œAddioâ€ has a juicy nightly sound, with a scratchy guitar solo among its selective loops. Itâ€™s hardly their best track but it was enough for me to dig into them. The rest of the bandâ€™s tracks also worth a listen.</p>
