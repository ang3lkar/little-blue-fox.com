I"Ò<p>And another track from an almost non-existent duo. There is hardly a single trace for Lili &amp; Sam found anywhere in the internet, which can be considered an accomplishment nowadays.</p>

<p>After considerable research, this is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leona_Naess">Leona Naess</a>, an amazing British (and underrated) artist and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083851">Sam Bisbee</a>, a singer/songwriter/producer/director.</p>

<p>This sweet track has a solid piano underneath serving the Leonaâ€™s smooth vocals on top. Itâ€™s also served with an unusual structure, no clean chorus and refrain bridge parts can be distinguished.</p>

<p>It seems this is something written exclusively for a cosmetics or shampoo ad, and they just decided to release it as a single.</p>
