I"<p>Back in the Last.fm days, a poised tune had caught my attention, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fbf5vhiH_c">Mancini - Up Country</a>.</p>

<p>Up Country was backed with a groovy line and confident female vocals. Mancini were a promising band, you could sense how they held instant appeal for fans of electro-indie-rock-female-led group bands such as Garbage.</p>

<p>I said this is promising, let’s see what else they’ve got. To my dissapointment, Mancini did not release anything else. Occasionaly, I am still into the mundane task of googling for news of the band and its members.</p>

<p>But, to my surprise, I discovered that Iraina Mancini, the voice of the group, released a fresh track in October 2018. ‘Undercover’ is a slice of french 60s inspired pop, with brass fillings and Iraina’s still-charming vocals.</p>

<p>I’ll say this to myself again, this is promising.</p>
